# Covert-Channels and Mitigation Approaches

Investigating covert channel and mitigation approaches for the network protocols IPv4 (and IPv6). Recently some of these techniques have been studied and published in which header fields are used to silently transmit information pieces from device to device. Within the project we will have two teams that use such approaches to silently reveal information on the one hand and at the same time try to identify smuggled information via such channels from the other team. The results from such game will subsequently be carefully documented wihin the project report. 

## How to run the framework
First run ./start_db.sh after that run ./start_server.sh on localhost port 80 should start the server.
